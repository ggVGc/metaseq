0.8.0 to 0.8.1:

  * Fixed error with missing CPP directive in ZMidi.Core.Pretty.


0.7.0 to 0.8.0:

  * Updated to compile without errors with GHC 7.10.


0.6.0 to 0.7.0:

  * Changed @ChannelPrefix@ constructor to have a single 
    argument - channel number (previously it stored a constant 
    tag 0x01 as well as channel number).

  * Added @SysExCont@ and @SysExEscape@ constructors to the 
    @MidiSysExEvent@ data type.

  * Added new pretty printers - @Csv@ based on @midicsv@ and 
    @Ascii@ based on the ASCII MIDI representation in the book 
    Beyond Midi (the zmidi ASCII representation is simplified).
    The demo application @MidiPrint@ now allows choice of pretty
    printer.

  * @printMidiHeader@ and @printMidiTrack@ from @Pretty@ changed
    to MidiFiles as arguments, @printMidi@ has now become 
    @putMidi@.


0.5.0 to 0.6.0:
  
  * Extended the parser and changed the syntax tree to interpret 
    MIDI Running Status. 
   
  * Added a module @ZMidi.Core.Canonical@ to translate MidiFiles
    to a canonical form where any shorthand NoteOff introduced by 
    Running Status is expanded to regular NoteOn and NoteOff 
    events (with Running Status set, MidiFiles can signal NoteOff 
    events as another NoteOn with 0 channel velocity).
  
  * Added a hack to the pretty printer to stop printing ASCII
    chars greater than 164 causing an error when printing to 
    stdout.
  

0.4.0 to 0.5.0:

  * Changed order of @MidiVoiceEnvent@ constructors so the Ord 
    instance follows the order of the /tag/ in the MIDI binary
    representation.
 
  * Changed @MidiSysCommonEvent@ to have different constructors 
    for unidentified F4 anf F5 events.   

  * Changed @MidiSysRealTimeEvent@ to have different constructors
    for unidentified F9 and FD events.  

  * Added more Haddock docs.

  * Various internal code changes.


0.3.0 to v0.4.0:

  * Added new constructors to @MidiMetaEvent@ for MidiPort and 
    MetaOther. MetaOther recognizes otherwise unrecognized events
    improving the robustness of the parser. Similarly a new 
    /other/ constructor has been added to @MidiScaleType@ to 
    avoid parse errors.


0.2.1 to 0.3.0:

  * Revised naming of the MIDI data types. All data types now have 
  the prefix Midi (previously only MidiFile followed this scheme).
  The rationale for this is client software, that might want a 
  higher-level representation, is then free to use the more 
  generic names Track, Message, etc.

  * @DeltaTime@ made a newtype wrapper rather than a type synonym.

  * Renamed the pretty print functions @track@ to @printMidiTrack@ 
    and @header@ to @printMidiHeader@.

  * Moved internal dataypes (SplitByte, Varlen) into a private 
    module.

0.2.0 to 0.2.1:

  * Added Show class constraints to various type signatures to 
    accommodate changes to Num superclass hierarchy in GHC 7.4.
    Thanks to Rémy Mouëza for the patches.

0.1.0 to 0.2.0:

  * Added a top-level /shim/ module to import all the exposed
    modules. Added a version number module

0.1.0:

  * Initial release.
